Since the beginning of the last decade, cyber security has been the most popular trend every year, despite the movement of system design from IDC on-premise deployment to cloud computing and blockchain. As cutting-edge technologies like big data and artificial intelligence entered the picture, companies began to build next-generation security techniques to address emerging threats and weaknesses on the internet. In order to update the defensive system from single misuse-based (signature-based) detection and keep the policy current, anomaly-based detection offers a dynamic data-driven method for integrating machine learning algorithms into intrusion detection frameworks.

A number of cloud computing service providers, including [Cisco Stealthwatch](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/stealthwatch-cloud/index.html) and [Azure Anomaly Detector](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/), have introduced anomaly-based detection with AI services. And if you have a tendency to imitate techniques, KDDCUP'99 provided one of the most popular publicly accessible data sets for training machine learning models and network-based anomaly detection systems. It covered a wide range of features for each network connection entry, such as the basic communication states, elements pertaining to the content, and statistical vectors based on time and host for traffic. Dos, Probe, R2L, and U2R are the four primary attacking classes found in the original dataset.

AARYAN VERMA released this [sample notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aaryanverma/anamoly-detection-with-82-accuracy-on-test-data) on Kaggle that demonstrated how to apply machine-learning models above the dataset and implement an anomaly-based detection model. In this example, the assaulting classes were typically condensed into a single category called “Attack,” which allowed us to train a binary classifier to detect future network violence using specific attributes. And it achieved a better result with Random Forests, reaching 82% accuracy, compared to Logistic Regression. I combined the code and dataset so you could use your laptop to execute the notebook locally. For you to have a better grasp of the model performance, I also added a confusion matrix at the end of it.
